\section{Technology considered}
\subsection{Weka}
The Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis was created to grant everyone access to state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in a unified environment~\cite{Hall:2009:WDM:1656274.1656278}. 
The workbench provides all kinds of machine learning algorithms, but we are most interested in the ones on classification. 
It is written in Java and it is free, available under the GNU General Public License. 
Although Weka comes with a powerful visualization tool, you can also access the library from your own Java code.
