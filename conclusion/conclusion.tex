\chapter{Conclusion And Future Work}
Student drop out prediction is an important task to reduce effor, time and money wasted.
In this paper we have discussed the problems of student attrition and retention.
We have discussed and presented several data mining techniques as well as data warehouse methods that would be helpful to utilize the student data laying idle in NTNU's databases.
A system has been proposed for estimating dropout and help employees utilize existing student data to improve student retention.
Although no tests have been run on real or imaginary data, a vast amount of preexisting literature exists which support our claims.

\bigskip\noindent
Future work will include the realization of the proposed system and testing on real student data.
Visual data mining should be considered to a greater extent and improvements to the FS system as well as mining data from it's learning would be helpful in increasing accuracy.
The main problem will be accessing this sensitive data and the underlying system.
