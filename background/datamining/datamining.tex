\section{Datamining}
Data mining is the process of automatically extracting useful information from a collection of data. There are several ways to analyse the data, including classification, association analysis, cluster analysis and anomaly detection. All these methods might be of use to us, but we will focus on the classification methods as this is the best tool for pinpointing certain students that will most likely quit and be able to give overall estimates for a whole class. We will also have a more superficial view on the other methods described.
