\subsubsection{Artificial Neural Network}
	Another technique from the discipline of artifical intelligence is artificial neural networks (\textbf{ANN}).
	Though ANNs may be used for a variaty of task, we will focus on what ANNs are and how they may be used as
	a classifier. 
	
	\bigskip\noindent
	First of, a general introduction to ANN is in order. ANNs are computation models that attempt to capture
	the behaviour and adaptive features of the brain by modeling it. 
	An ANN therefore consists of a set of neurons, the computational unit, and their synapses, the relationship between neurons (see figure~\ref{fig:ann}).
