\subsection{Classification}
The classification problem consists of building a model capable of determining
the class/category of new observations on the basis of previously seen data. 
Training of a classifier is done by feeding it data where the class of the all the instances are known.
Once completed the classifier has created a model describing the training data, 
and can therefore determine the class of new and unique instances.
For this specific project the usage of classification will be to determine whether or not a 
given student is prone to dropping out and why. 
We therefore want an algorithm that correctly classifies the outcome for a given student, 
but also an algorithm that can shine some light into why students do not complete their
study.

%The methods described as classification methods are mostly tweaked algorithms taken from the field of artificial intelligence. 
%We will start by describing some of the more promising algorithms for our problem and data.
