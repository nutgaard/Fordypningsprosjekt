\chapter{Project proposition}
	For the general structure of a education datamining system we propose 
	a six step process~(fig:~\ref{fig:steps}). 
	The first three should be recognized from the chapter on data warehousing. 
	Step four is an intermidiate step which falls outside the realm of datawarehousing and datamining. 
	The motivation behind this step is to enable flexibility in the datastructure, since classifiers may need different structured data.
	Step five is the datamining step were Weka will be used as a basis
	in order to analyse the data. 
	The final step will revolve around the presentation of results from the analysis.
