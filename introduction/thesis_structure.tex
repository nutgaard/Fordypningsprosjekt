			\item[Chapter 2] provides the theoretical knowledge necessary to understand what datawarehouseing and datamining is. 
				It will not provide a complete and in depth explaination of these disciplines, as that would require several books.
				The end of the chapter briefly discusses different possible frameworks for these diciplines.
			\item[Chapter 3] digs deeper into the interdisciplinary world of datamining, and looks at related works and technologies.
			\item[Chapter 4] will provide a proposal for the system design and technology, 
				including key concepts of the data warehouse architecture.
			\item[Chapter 5] concludes our findings and outlines future work.
