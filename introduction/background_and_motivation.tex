\section{Background and motivation}
	The main motivation for this project is to provide the institutes and faculties at NTNU 
	with the necessary tools to identify struggling students, and what their struggles are.
	This will be done in an effort to mitigate the relative high drop out rate which has been
	seen in norwegian education. 
	In 2013 only 59\% of the students starting at one of the higher educational institutes completed their study.
	In comparison to a 68\% average when looking at the other 34 OECD countries.\cite{OECD2013}
