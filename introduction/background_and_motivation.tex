\section{Background and motivation}
	The main motivation for this project is to provide the institutes and faculties at NTNU 
	with the necessary tools to identify students who requires extra motivation, and what the bane of these students are.
	This will be done in an effort to mitigate the relative high drop out rate which has been
	seen in norwegian education.
	Research published in 2013 showed that only 59\% of the students
	starting at one of the higher edcucation institutes in Norway completed their study.
	In comparison to a 68\% average when looking at the other 34 OECD countries.\cite{OECD2013}
	
	Futher motivation comes from the fact that the educational institutes in Norway collects
	copius amounts of data for each student. Though necessary in order to keep track of the progression, 
	this data is to a large extend idle. And is not used in order to further develop the quality of education. 
	This project will serve as an introductary analysis of the possible analyses of this data, 
	and take a deep dive into the possible emergent information this data can hold.
