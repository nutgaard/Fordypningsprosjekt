\section{Problem definition}
	Based on the background and motivation, the goal of this project can be summerized as: 
	
	
	\textit{Do an introductory study of datawarehousing and datamining to find possible angles of attack in
	creating an platform for student data analysis. }\newline
	
	This can be broken down into several question, all of which should be answered in this paper.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What database type and schema are currently used within datawarehouseing. 
			And how can these be utilized to provide the most flexible backbone to an analyses platform.
		\item What datamining techniques currently exist, how can these be used to discover useful information
		within student data?
		\item Which, if any, premade partial solutions exist, including software libraries. 
		And how can these be utilized to simplify the project realization.
	\end{enumerate}
